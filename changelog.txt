CHANGELOG


decided to go back to pygames built in collision stuff since mine was basically the same but worse
did learn more about how to do some things from my custom attempt tho.



----------------------------------------------------------
got collisions working (mostly)
probably gonna go back to sprite.collideany cause im pretty sure it does the same thing im doing now
can push other ents






-----------------------------------------------------------

- started work on a new physics system 
 - does nothing currently
 - should be easier to handle collision than the (i think) jank sprite.collideany method.


-----------------------------------------------------------
- Moved movement stuff into parent Entity class

- added enemy that follows the player
  - when near it will overlay red to show its in attack range or whatever
  - player will bounce on head
  - will attempt to jump over terrain between the player
  
  
- added hopping as default movement 
  - Hold shift to 'sprint' (speed*1.2), stops hopping


- added collision to terrain (kinda)
